what is the predominant mineral in sandstone?:  
quartz


What is the principle of cross-cutting relationships?:  
says that geologic features like intrusions have to have formed AFTER the rocks that they cut across

used in relative age dating


What is the principle of fossil succession?:  
Fossil organisms succeed one another in a definite and determinable order, and therefore any time period can be recognized by its fossil content.


What is the principle of inclusion?:  
the rock containing the inclusions must be younger than the inclusions 

used in relative age dating


What is the principle of lateral continuity?:  
says that layers are continuous until encountering an obstruction or edge or grade into a different type of sediment

used in relative age dating


What is the principle of original horizontality?:  
Says that layers of sediment are generally deposited in a horizontal position

rock layers that are flat still have their original horizontality (vs being folded or inclined by disturbances)

used in relative age dating


What is the principle of superposition?:  
In an undeformed sequence, the oldest rocks are at the bottom and the youngest rocks are at the top

used in relative age dating


what is the relationship between metamorphic facies and plate tectonics:  
plate tectonics are the site of many metamorphic facies like:
hornfels
zeolite
greenschist
amphibolite
granulite
blueschist
eclogite


What is the relationship between superposition and original horizontality?:  
allows us to extend relative age relationships over large areas since they should all be same composition


What is the streak property of a mineral?:  
The colour of a mineral in powdered form


What is the tenacity property of a mineral?:  
A mineral's resistance to breaking, bending, cutting, and other forms of deformation (brittle vs malleable)


What structure makes up all silicate minerals?:  
Silicon-oxygen tetrahedron (1 silicon, 4 oxygen, covalent bond)


What three eras does the current eon (can you name it?) consist of?:  
(Phanerozoic) 

Cenozoic, Mesozoic, Paleozoic (cmp)


What three factors influence the textures of igneous rocks?:  
-Rate at which molten rock cools
-amount of silica present in magma
-amount of dissolved gases in magma


What type of igneous rock is formed when lava solidifies on the surface?:  
Extrusive igneous rocks, found in western Americas, Hawaiian islands


What type of igneous rock is formed when magma crystallizes inside the crust?:  
Intrusive igneous rocks, found in Mt Rushmore, Yosemite


what type(s) of rock make up most of Earth?:  
igneous and metamorphic, but sedimentary is found more on the surface


When does magma form?:  
When crystalline structures vibrate fast enough and break free of bonds, they melt from solid to liquid


Where do most earthquakes occur?:  
along plate boundaries

example circum-Pacific Belt, running along asia and america and south america


Where does metamorphism occur?:  
deep within earth's crust


Where does most magma formation occur?:  
Convergent plate boundaries, due to decompression melting and water introduction to facilitate melting


Who theorized continental drift and plate tectonics?:  
Alfred Wegener


why are landslides commonly associated with volcanoes?:  
volcanoes have steep cones, more easily slide

eruptions trigger landslides

magma intrusions cause disturbances in ground rock


Why do polymorphs have such different properties?:  
The conditions in which they form are different (pressure, temperature, etc)


why is carbon so important:  
carbon is found in life forms, in atmosphere, everywhere

carbon cycle moves energy from atmosphere to biosphere and back and forth


Why is the Precambrian not divided into many time subdivisions whereas the Paleozoic, Mesozoic and Cenozoic are?:  
- not as much fossil evidence
- many changes to rocks in this period
