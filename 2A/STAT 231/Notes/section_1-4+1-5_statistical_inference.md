# Data Analysis & Statistical Inference

There are two broad aspects of analysis and interpretation of data:

####Descriptive Statistics

This is when we take data and portray it in numerical and graphical ways, so we can show the variates or features that we are interested in.

The graphs, charts, tables, in the previous section are all examples of this aspect of data analysis.

####Statistical Inference

When we use this data to draw conclusions or say something about a population or process, this is ==statistical inference==.  Since we use data about a sample of the population/process, this is __inductive reasoning__ - we're using a specific set of data to infer things about the general population.

> There is also deductive reasoning, where we use general results to prove specific things (kinda the opposite), like using axioms to create proofs of specific theorems in math.

In this course, we examine **3 main types of problems**:

#### 1. Estimation Problems

We want to **estimate** the **attributes** of the population or process. 

Some examples include:

- Estimate the proprtion of STAT 231 students who like poutine
- Estimate the distribution of waiting times at a hospital's ER
- Find a distribution that makes the most sense for a process

#### 2. Hypothesis Testing Problems

After posing a question or hypothesis, we use the data to **assess the truth or validity of the question**.

Some examples include:

- Is it true that a higher proportion of math students than CS students like poutine?
- Will the introduction of a new computer system reduce waiting times at the hospital's ER?

####3. Prediction Problems

Use the data to predict a future value of a variate for a unite that is selected from the population or process.

Some examples include:

- Given the past performance of a stock and other data, predict the value of the stock at some point in the future
- Based on the results of a clinical trial, predict how much an individualâ€™s blood pressure would drop for a given dosage of a drug
