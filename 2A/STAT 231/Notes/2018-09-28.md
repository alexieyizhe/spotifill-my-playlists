# Maximum Likelihood (cont.)

 Fitting the data to a probability model allows us to gain additional information that the observed data might not tell us.
   - *e.g.* In the example of hockey goals, $P(Y > 7)$ would be 0 if we look at the observed data (highest amount of goals scored was 7), but we know how to compute this:
      $$e_{7+} = 82P(Y>=7)$$
   We also know that $P(Y>=7)$ is $1 - P(Y<6)$.
   Therefore,
      $$e_{7+} = 82(1-P(Y<6))$$

> Leave your answers in exact values to avoid arithmetic errors, and double-check that the observed and expected values sum up to the same value!

### Continuous Data
To measure the fit of continuous datasets with a certain model, we need to **split the data into intervals**. Now, the expected value is the probability that the random variable falls into one of the intervals we defined.

> Gaussian and Normal distributions are the same model, but have different parameters!
