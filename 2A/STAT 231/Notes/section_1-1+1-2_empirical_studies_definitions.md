# Empirical Studies

### Key Terms

An ==empirical study== is __a study in which we learn by observation or experimentation.__

A ==unit== is **an individual person, place, or thing which we can measure**.

A ==population== is **a collection of units**.

A ==process== is **a system by which units are produced.**

> Both _populations_ and _processes_ are collections of units, but population is static and processes occur over time.

==Variates== are __characteristics of the units,__ usually represented by variables like $x, y, z$. There are different types:

- ==continuous==: __numerical__ values that can be measured to an infinite degree of accuracy
- ==discrete==: __numerical__ values that can only be a certain number of values
- ==categorical==: __non-numerical__ values that put _variates_ in categories (_ex. hair colour, university choice_)
- ==ordinal==: **non-numerical** values that are categorical, but have an implied order
- ==complex==: __non-numerical__ and not necessarily values, like text or an image

Variates can be separated into two categories: 

1. The ==response variate==, which is the focus of the study; what we're trying to predict or explain
2. The ==explanatory variate==, which can be anything that may affect the response variate

An ==attribute== of a _population_ or _process_ is a __function of a variate which is defined for all units__ (_ex. if the population of interest is all persons aged 18-25 in Ontario, an attribute of interest might be the proportion of the population that owns a smartphone_).

### Types of Empirical Studies

There are three types of empirical studies:

#### Sample Surveys

==Sample surveys== are where information is obtained about a __finite__ population by selecting a __sample__ of units and determining variates of interest for each unit. Since it's finite, the survey is asking __specific questions__ to attempt to find answers about a __complete population__ (_ex. voters voting for a specific party in the next election_) and units usually only **complete the survey once**.

#### Observational Study

==Observational studies== are where information about a **general** population or process is collected without changing any variates. These studies usually try to __observe everything of interest__ to get a general sense of a population of theoretically infinite size, or a population that's conceptual (_ex. amount of people at risk of a disease_). These studies are also **conducted over time instead of at once**.

#### Experimental Study

==Experimental Studies== are where the people conducting the experiment __changes or sets the value of variate(s)__ for the units in the study. These studies are usually easy to distinguish from the above two since it's the **only one where variates are altered**.

> On an exam question, a study could be interpreted correctly as either one of the first two studies as long as reasonable justification is provided.
