# PPDAC Algorithm

The steps of this algorithm are:

- **Problem:** A clear statement of the study's objectives.
- **Plan:** The procedures used to carry out the study, including how the data will be collected, what steps to take to measure them, etc.
- **Data:** The physical collection of the data, as described in the **Plan** step.
- **Analysis**: The analysis of the data collected, taking into account the **Problem** and the **Plan**.
- **Conclusion**: The conclusions that are drawn about the **Problem** and their limitations.



### Error in Studies

### Things To Consider for PPDAC

1. What **type of study** is this and why?

   > Think about if the researchers changed/controlled any variates. If so, then it's very likely observational. If there's a survey mentionef in the study, a sample survey is also very likely.

2. Define the **Problem** for this study.

   > What are the researchers themselves trying to find out? Look for a quote or a conclusion in the article.

3. Is the type of **Problem** descriptive, causative, or predictive? Explain why.

4. What are the $n$ most important **variates** in this study and what is their type?

   > What is being measured?

5. Define a suitable **target population** for this study.

   > Who are the researchers interested in studying? If nothing is explicitly stated, look at who the study consisted of and extrapolate to a larger population. Make sure you're being as specific as possible.

6. Define a suitable **study population** for this study.

   > Note that the __units in the study population may be systematically different to units in target population in terms of some attribute__!
   >
   > As well, the study population is always a subset of the target population (most of the time it's a strict subset).

7. Give a possible source of **study error** for this study in relation to your answers to to 5) and 6).

8. What information is given about the **sampling protocol** for this study?

   > You don't have to reshape the description with your own words; precision matters more so you can reuse the wording in the original article if it answers the question.

9. Give a possible source of **sample error** for this study based on the information you have stated in 8).

10. What type of **numerical summary** is `some number they mentioned`?
