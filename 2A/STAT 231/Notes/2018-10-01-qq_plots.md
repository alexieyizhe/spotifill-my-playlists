# Q-Q Plots

We suck at estimating curves.

$$ Y ~ G(50, 10) \Rightarrow q(0.5)=50 $$

We expect that the theoretical quantiles match up to the observed values. This way, we can better estimate how the observed values fit into the Gaussian (Normal) model.

_ex._ if there were 99 data points, $q(0.01)$ should be roughly equal to the first data point.

This is what a __Q-Q plot__ attempts to plot.

__Definitions__: __Heavy-tailed__ means that more data is present at the tails (thus being heavy), and __light-tailed__ is the same but vice versa.

 - An $S$ shaped Q-Q plot indicates symmetry
   - should look at _kurtosis_
 - A $U$ shaped or non-$S$ shaped plot indicates asymmetry
   - should look at _skewness_

##### Log-normal distribution
 - Asymmetric
 - Negative skew


> These are the main 4 types of distributions and they are __ESSENTIAL__.
> _symmetric + low/high kurtosis_, or _asymmetric + pos/neg skew_


### Tips n' tricks for reading Q-Q plots
 - points are a straight line? __NORMAL__.
 - $S$-shaped? usually __SYMMETRIC__ with __LOW SKEW__.
 - $U$-shaped? __ASYMMETRIC__.
 - Asymmetric with more points on left/right tail? __POSITIVE/NEGATIVE SKEW__.
 - Symmetric with more/less points on tails? __HIGH/LOW KURTOSIS__.
 - b precise and wordy
