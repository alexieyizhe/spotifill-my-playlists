# Coloring Graphs/Planar Graphs

We colour the vertices such that adjacent vertices get different colours.

__Some Facts:__ 

1. A graph can be coloured with 2 colours _iff_ it is bipartite.
2. A graph can be coloured with 1 colour _iff_ it has no edges.
3. An odd cycle needs 3 colours.
4. A complete graph with $n$ vertices ($K_n$) needs $n$ colours.

==__Theorem^2^:__ Let $G$ be a graph and let $\triangle(G)$ denote the largest degree of any vertex in $G$. Then $G$ can be coloured with $\triangle(G) + 1$ colours.==

__Proof of Theorem^2^__
We proceed by induction on $|V(G)|$.

_Base Case:_ $|V(G)| = 1$
In this case, $\triangle(G) = 0$ and $G$ can indeed be coloured with 1 colour.

If $|V(G)| > 1$, let $v$ be any vertex of $G$ and let $H = G - v$. Then $\triangle(H) \leq \triangle(G)$ and by induction, $H$ can be coloured with $\triangle(H) + 1$ colours.
The vertex $v$ has $\leq \triangle(G)$ neightbours in $H$, so those neighbours are coloured with at $\leq \triangle(G)$ colours.  Thus, at least 1 colour out of the $\triangle(G) + 1$ colours is available to colour $v$ a colour that is different from its neighbours. QED.
