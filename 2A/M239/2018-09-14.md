# Combinatorial Proofs
When doing __combinatorial proofs__, we _prove that two things are equal_ by constructing a set that can be counted in two ways. 

> If we want to prove $A = B$, then we would create a set where counting it in one way is $A$, and counting it a different way results in $B$.

___Binomial Theorem_: For any $n \in \N$,
$$(1 + x)^n = \Sigma^n_{k=0} {n \choose k} x^k$$
