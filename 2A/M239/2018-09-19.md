# Formal Power Series
Let $a_0, a_1,...$ be a sequence of rational numbers. Then, the __formal power series__ associated with $\{a_n\}$ is:

$$A(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + ... = \sum\limits_{k \geq 0}a_k x^k$$

  - Coefficients of $x^n$ in $A(x)$ are denoted $[x^n]A(x)$
  - Two power series are _equal_ if they have the same coefficients for the same powers
    - $A(x) = B(x) \Longleftrightarrow \forall n \geq 0, [x^n]A(x) = [x^n]B(x)$

> Essentially we are using the coefficients to represent the terms in the sequence, we don't really care that much about convergence or the values that $x$ takes!

### Operations on Power Series

#### Addition
$A(x) + B(x) = \sum\limits_{n \geq 0}(a_n + b_n) x^n$

#### Multiplication
$A(x)B(x) = \sum\limits_{n \geq 0}(\sum\limits_{k=0}^na_k b_{n-k})x^n$

#### Inverses
The __inverse__ of a power series $A(x)$ is $B(x)$ _iff_ $A(x)B(x) = 1$.
  - Denoted $A^{-1}(x)$

___Theorem:_ A formal power series has an inverse _iff_ it has a non-zero constant term. If that is true, then the inverse is unique.__

___Theorem:_ If $A(x)$ and $B(x)$ are formal power series with the constant term of $B(x)$ equal to zero, then $A(B(x))$ is a formal power series.__
