# Coloring Graphs

We colour the vertices such that adjacent vertices get different colours.

__Some Facts:__ 

1. A graph can be coloured with 2 colours _iff_ it is bipartite.
2. A graph can be coloured with 1 colour _iff_ it has no edges.
3. An odd cycle needs 3 colours.
4. A complete graph with $n$ vertices ($K_n$) needs $n$ colours.

==__Theorem^2^:__ Let $G$ be a graph and let $\triangle(G)$ denote the largest degree of any vertex in $G$. Then $G$ can be coloured with $\triangle(G) + 1$ colours.==

------

__Proof of Theorem^2^__
We proceed by induction on $|V(G)|$.

_Base Case:_ $|V(G)| = 1$
In this case, $\triangle(G) = 0$ and $G$ can indeed be coloured with 1 colour.

If $|V(G)| > 1$, let $v$ be any vertex of $G$ and let $H = G - v$. Then $\triangle(H) \leq \triangle(G)$ and by induction, $H$ can be coloured with $\triangle(H) + 1$ colours.
The vertex $v$ has $\leq \triangle(G)$ neightbours in $H$, so those neighbours are coloured with at $\leq \triangle(G)$ colours.  Thus, at least 1 colour out of the $\triangle(G) + 1$ colours is available to colour $v$ a colour that is different from its neighbours. QED.

Eventually, we'll prove that every _planar graph_ can be properly coloured with $5$ colours.



# Planar Graphs

A __planar graph__ is a graph that can be represented in a single plane without two edges of the graph ever intersecting.

- An $n$-cycle is planar: we can represent it by a regular $n$-gon (pentagon, hexagon, etc)
- Every tree is planar: we can prove this using induction

### Faces

__Faces__ are enclosed regions defined by the edges and vertices of a planar graph. Each enclosed area is considered a single face, and an additional face is defined to be the __outer face__, the region outside the graph.

> You can distinguish different faces based on if you cross an edge or not (if you do, its a different face).

- A tree has 1 face (no region is enclosed since there are no cycles)

==__Euler's Formula For Connected Graphs:__ If $G$ is a _connected graph embedded in the plane_, then $|V(G)| - |E(G)| + |Faces(G)| = 2$==

==__Euler's Formula (General Version):__ For all graphs embedded in the plane, then $|V(G)| - |E(G)| + |Faces(G)| = 1 + components(G)$==
