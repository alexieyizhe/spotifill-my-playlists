# Generating Series
A __generating series__ for a set of configurations $S$ with weight function $w$ is:
$$\Phi_{S}(x) = \sum\limits_{a \in S} x^{w(a)}$$
which is equivalent to
$$\Phi_{S}(x) = \sum\limits_{k \geq 0} a_k x^k$$
where $a_k$ is the number of elements in $S$ with weight $k$.
  - A __configuration__ can be anything (numbers, sets, etc)
  - A __weight function__ is defined on a configuration in the set (sum of numbers, etc)

==___Theorem:__ Let $\Phi_S(x)$ be the generating series for a finite set $S$ with weight function $w$. Then:==

  1. $\Phi_S(1) = |S|$
  2. $\Phi_S'(1) =$ sum of weights of elements
  3. $\Phi_S'(1)/\Phi_S(1) =$ avg. weight of element
