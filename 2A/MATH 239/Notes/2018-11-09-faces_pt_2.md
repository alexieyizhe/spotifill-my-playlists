# Faces (cont.)

The __degree__ of a face is the length of its boundary walk.

> You might have to traverse an edge twice if it's a leaf edge that extends into the face - this will indeed add 2 to the degree of the face.

==__The Faceshake Lemma:__ Let $F$ be the set of faces of a planar embedding of a graph $G$. For each face $f \in F$, denote the degree of $f$ as $d^*(f)$. Then, $\sum\limits_{f \in F} d^*(f) = 2 |E(G)|$.==

> This is because every edge has two sides, and each side will be traversed exactly once. Sometimes this will be in the traversal of a single face, sometimes two faces, sometimes more, but each side is always part of exactly one traversal.
