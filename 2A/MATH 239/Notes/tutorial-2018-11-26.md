1. __Strategy:__ if $M$ is maximum, it is not perfect, find an augmenting path

   Suppose $M$ is a maximum matching that is _not_ perfect

2. Build a bipartite graph $G = (B, W, \epsilon)$

   with $B$ = black squares, $W$ = white squares, and two squares are adjacent _iff_ a domino can cover them.

   if $u \in B$, $v \in W$, show that $G \setminus \{u, v\}$ has a perfect matching. $G$ has a perfect matching by taking alternate edges in this cycle. If $uv \in M$, then we're done.

   If we let $P_1, P_2$ be the two paths in this cycle between $u,v$ we know that the edges must have odd length since the vertices are opposite colours.
