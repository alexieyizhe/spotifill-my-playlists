# Faces (cont.)

==__Today's Theorem:__==

1. Every planar graph has a vertex with degree at most 5.

2. If $G$ is a planar graph with at least 3 vertices, then $|E(G) \leq 3|V(G)| - 6$.

   _this is not an iff!_

3. $K_5$ is not planar. 

==__Lemma^1^:__ Let $G$ be a connected graph embedded in the plane. If $|V(G)| \geq 3$, then every face has degree at least 3.==

__Proof of Lemma^1^__
Let $F$ be the face and let $uv$ be an edge in the boundary walk of $F$. Because $G$ is connected and has at least 3 vertices, at least one of $u, v$ has degree at least 2 in $G$; say $u$ has degree $\geq 2$.

This implies that, starting the boundary walk of $F$ at $v$ and proceeding first to $u$, we must traverse a new edge $ux$ next (since $u$ has degree $\geq 2$). Since $x \not= v$, we still have to return to $v$, so there is at least one more step in the boundary walk of $F$. This means that $deg(F) \geq 3$.          $QED$

__Proof of Theorem^2^__
Suppose first $G$ is connected. By Lemma^1^, every face has degree $\geq 3$ and the Faceshake Lemma says that $2|E(G)| = \sum\limits_{all faces F} deg(F)$. Putting these last two sentences together, $2|E(G)| = \sum\limits_{all faces F} deg(F) \geq 3|F(G)|$. 

Euler's formula says $|V(G)| - |E(G)| + |F(G)| = 2$. Since rearranging the inequality above gives us $|F(G)| \leq \frac{2}{3}|E(G)|$, we see that $2 = |V(G)| - |E(G)| + |F(G)| \leq |V(G)| - |E(G)| + \frac{2}{3}|E(G)|$.

So, $2 \leq |V(G)| - \frac{1}{3} |E(G)|$, and we rearrange to get $|E(G)| \leq 3|V(G)| - 6$.

To complete the proof, suppose $G$ is not connected. Then $G$ has $\alpha$ components that are $\bullet$ (single vertices), $\beta$ components that are $\bullet -\bullet$, and $\gamma$ components with $\geq 3$ vertices. 

$|E(G)| = \sum\limits_{all \ components \ C} |E(C)|$ = $E(\alpha) + E(\beta) + \sum\limits_{all \ components \geq 3 \ vertices} |E(C)|$ = $0 + \beta + \sum\limits_{all \ components \geq 3 \ vertices} |E(C)|$.

$|V(G)| = \sum\limits_{all \ components \ C} |V(C)|$ = $\alpha + 2\beta + \sum\limits_{all \ components \geq 3 \ vertices} |V(C)|$.

_proof incomplete for non-connected graphs, but is not as important to know compare to connectedness_

__Proof of Theorem^3^__
We proceed by proof by contradiction. If $K_5$ were planar, then Theorem^2^ tells us that $|E(K_5)| \leq 3 |V(K_5)| - 6$. Substituting in known values, $10 = {5 \choose 2} \leq 3 * 5 - 6 = 9$, and since $10 \not\leq 9$, this is a contradiction and thus $K_5$ is not planar.

__Proof of Theorem^1^__
If $|V(G)| \leq 2$, then every vertex $v$ has $deg(v) \leq$ 2.

Thus, we may assume $|V(G)| \geq 3$. Then Theorem^2^ implies $|E(G)| \leq 3|V(G)| - 6$. The smallest degree is $\leq$ the average degree = $\frac{\sum\limits{v \in V(G)}deg(v)}{|V(G)|}$ = $\frac{2|E(G)|}{|V(G)|} \leq \frac{6|V(G)| - 12}{|V(G)|} = 6 - \frac{12}{|V(G)|} \leq 5$, so the smallest degree $\leq 5$.        $QED$
