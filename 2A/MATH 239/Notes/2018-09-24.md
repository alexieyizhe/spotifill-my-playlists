# Compositions
A __composition__ of $n$ with $k$ parts is an ordered list ($c_1, c_2,...,c_k$) of positive integers $c_1,...,c_k$ such that $c_1 + ... + c_k = n$.
  - Each of $c_1,...,c_k$ is a __part__ of the composition
  - $n, k$ are non-negative integers
  - There is just ONE composition of 0, known as the _empty composition_; it has 0 parts
    - Denoted with the empty tuple $()$
- The weight function $w$ of a composition is usually equal to the sum of its parts (which is $n$).

There are ${{n-1} \choose {k-1}}$ compositions of $n$ with $k$ parts, for $n \geq k \geq 1$.

### Composition Problems
In general, to solve problems along the lines of `how many compositions of n are there with ...`:
  1. Find a set $S$ that represents all possible compositions of a certain type (without considering $n$)
  2. Find $\Phi_S(x)$ where $w(a_1,...,a_k) = a_1 + ... + a_k$
  3. The number of compositions of $n$ is $[x^n]\Phi_S(x)$
  4. Try to find an explicit formula for $[x^n]\Phi_S(x)$ or try to simplify if possible with series, etc
