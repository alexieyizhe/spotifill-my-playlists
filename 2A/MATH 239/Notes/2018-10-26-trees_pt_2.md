# Trees: the sequel

==__Lemma^2^__: Let $u, v$ be vertices in a graph $G$ such that there are two different $u, v$ paths in $G$. Then, $G$ has a cycle.==

__Proof of Lemma^2^__
Let $(u, v_1, v_2, ... , v_{k-1}, v)$ and $(u ,w_1, w_2, ..., w_{l - 1}, v)$ be two different $uv$-paths in $G$. Let $i$ be the least index such that $v_i \neq w_i$. Let $e$ be the edge $w_{i - 1} \rightarrow w_iâ€‹$.

We will prove that in $G - e$, there is a path between $w_{i - 1} \rightarrow w_i$. Observe that $e$ is not an edge of $(u, v_1, v_2, ... , v_{k-1}, v)$. We also know that $v_{i -1}$ is not one of the vertices $v_i, v_{i + 1}, ..., v_{k - 1}, v$. Therefore, none of the edges $v_{i - 1} \rightarrow v_i, v_i \rightarrow v_{i + 1}, ..., v_{k - 1} \rightarrow v$ is e. 

For the proof, we concatenate the paths $(w_i, w_{i + 1}, ..., w_{l - 1}, v)$ and $(v, v_{k - 1}, ..., v_i, v_{i - 1})$. This is a $w_i w_{i-1}$-walk in $G - e$!

A graph with no cycles is a __forest__. Each component of a forest is a tree.

For a tree T, $\sum\limits_{v \in V(T)} deg(V) = 2(|V(T)| - 1) = 2|V(T)| - 2$.

==__Fact:__ Every tree has a vertex $v$ with $deg(v) \lt 2$.==

> The graph $\bullet$ is the only tree with vertex of $deg \ 0$.

==If $|V(T)| \geq 2$, then $T$ has at least two vertices with $deg = 1$.== These vertices with $deg = 1$ are called __leaves.__

> Useful: Suppose $T$ is a tree with at least two vertices. The ends of a longest path in $T$ have degree 1 in $T$.
>
> Useful: Suppose $G$ is a graph in which every vertex has degree $\geq 2$. Then $G$ has a cycle.
