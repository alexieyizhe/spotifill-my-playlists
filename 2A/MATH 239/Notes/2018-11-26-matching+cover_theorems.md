==__Lemma:__ If $M$ and $C$ are a matching and a cover in a graph $G$, respectively, then $|M| \leq |C|$ .==

==__Side Lemma:__ If $M$ and $C$ are a matching and a cover in a graph $G$, respectively, and $|M| = |C|$, then $M$ is a maximum matching in $G$ and $C$ is a minimum cover in $G$.==

### KÃ¶nig's Theorem

==If $G$ is a bipartite graph, then the size of a maximum matching and the sizd of a minimum cover are equal.==
