1. **Let $G$ be a connected planar graph.** 

   1. **Prove that in any planar embedding of $G$, the number of faces with odd degree is even.**

      > Recall that we saw a similar question before, but it was asking about hte number of _vertices_ with odd degree. We proved this using the Handshake Lemma. 

      The Faceshake Lemma tells us that $\sum\limits_{f \in F} deg(f) = 2 |E|$, where $F$ is the set of all faces in $G$. Furthermore, we know that $\sum\limits_{f \in F} deg(f) = \sum\limits_{f \in F_e} deg(f)  + \sum\limits_{f \in F_o} deg(f)$, where $F_o, F_e$ are the set of all faces with odd degree and even degree, respectively. If the number of faces with odd degree is odd, then $\sum\limits_{f \in F} deg(F) $ would be odd, which is a contradiction. ==$QED.$==

   2. **Prove that if $G$ is not bipartite, any planar embedding of $G$ has $\geq 2$ faces with odd degree.**

      By the Bipartite Characterization Theorem, $G$ contains an odd cycle, $C$. Let $F_1, ..., F_k$ be all the inner faces of $C$, and $D$ be the set of edges inside $C$.

      Note that $\sum\limits_{i = 1}^k deg(F_i) = |E(C)| + 2|D|$. We know $|E(C)| + 2|D|$ is odd (odd + even), so that means that $\sum\limits_{i = 1}^k deg(F_i)$ has to have at least one odd cycle. By part a), there are $\geq 2$ faces with odd degree. ==$QED.$==

2. **Prove in at least two different ways that the Petersen graph (shown below) is not planar.**

   Note that this graph has 10 vertices and 15 edges.

   __Method 1:__ Use _Kuratowski's Theorem_ to find a subdivision of $K_{3,3}$ or $K_5$ in the graph above.

   Define two sets: $A = \{a, h, i\} $ and $B = \{b, e, f\}$. The following edges can be created through removing subdivisions without crossing each other: $ab, ae, af, hf, hje, hcb, if, igb, ide$. This is a $K_{3,3}$ graph, proving that the Petersen graph is not planar.

   A clearer way to show this is to draw out the $K_{3,3}$ graph and label them with the vertices from the graph above(_do this on exams and stuff_)

   __Method 2:__ Use *Proof By Contradiction* 

   This graph is connected. Assume that the graph is planar. By _Euler's Formula_, $v - e + f = 2$, or $f = e + 2 - v$.

   In general, we know that $2e \geq 3f$, and $2e = \sum deg(f) \geq 5f$ for the Petersen graph, since there is no $C_3$ or $C_4$.

   So, $2e \geq 5f = 5(e + 2 - v)$

   $2e \geq 10 + 5e - 5v$

   $3e \leq 5v - 10$

   $15 = e \leq \frac{5}{3}v - \frac{10}{3} = \frac{5}{3}(10) - \frac{10}{3} = 40/3$, which is a contradiction! 

   __Method 3:__ Recall if $G$ is planar, then $G \setminus e$is too. $G \setminus \{af, bg, ch, di, e\}$ is related to $K_5$. 

   ==$ QED. $==  

3. __Method:__ try induction

4. **Let $T_1, T_2$ be two trees defined on the same vertex set $V$. Let $G$ be the graph with vertex set $V$ and edge set $E(T_1) \cup E(T_2)$. Show that $G$ is 4-colourable. Why must every edge subdivision of $G$ also be 4-colourable?**

   We know that trees are bipartite and can be coloured with 2 colours, so $T_1, T_2$ have unique 2-colourings. We define a "coordinate pair" for each vertex $(a, b)$ where $a$ is the colouring of it from $T_1$, and $b$ is the colouring of it from $T_2$, where $a, b$ are one of two colours (define to be $1, 2$). We colour them one colour if the coordinates match $(2, 2)$, another if they match $(1, 1)$, and two more depending on if they are $(2, 1)$ or $(1, 2)$. This is a proper colouring because adjacent vertices in $G$ were either adjacent in $T_1$, which means they will receive one colouring or adjacent in $T_2$, hence they receive different coordinates.

   The outer edge of edge subdivisions have already used 2 colours, so we use the remaining 2 to colour the "inner" edges. Since the "inner edges" form a path, they must be 2-colourable. Hence, the edge subdivisions of $G$ are also 4-colourable.    ==$ QED. $==
