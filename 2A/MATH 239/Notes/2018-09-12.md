# Intro to Enumeration
The __cardinality__ of a finite set $A$ is $|A|$.

The __Cartesian product__ of two sets $A$ and $B$ is $A \times B = \{(a,b) | a \in A, b \in B\}$:
  - Can be extended to $n$ sets
  - $A^k = A \times A \times ... \times A$ ($k$ times)
  - $A^0 = \{()\}$ (a set containing the empty tuple)
  - $|A \times B| = |A||B|$ (if $A, B$ are finite)

If two sets $A, B$ are _disjoint_, then $|A \cap B|$ = $|A| + |B|$.

___Theorem:_ For non-negative integers $n$ and $k$, the number of $k$-element subsets of an $n$-element set is:__
$$\frac{n(n-1)...(n-k+1)}{k!}$$


### Bijections
A __bijection__ is a function that is injective and surjective.

> In other words, a function is bijective if every element maps to a unique element, and every element is being mapped to from some element.

To prove a function is bijective, we _find an inverse_.

___Theorem:_ If a function $f: S \rightarrow T$ has an inverse, then $f$ is a bijection.__
