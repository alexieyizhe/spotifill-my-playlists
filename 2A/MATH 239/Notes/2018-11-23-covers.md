# Covers

*From last time:* A __matching__ is a set $M$ of edges in a graph $G$ such that every *vertex* of $G$ is incident with _at most_ one *edge* in $M$.

A __cover__ is a set $C$ of vertices in a graph $G$ such that every *edge* of $G$ is incident with _at least_ one *vertex* in $C$.

> These two terms are essentially the same, just describing relationships between vertices and edges.

### Common Graphs

| Graph Type            | Largest Matching                           | Smallest Cover                           |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| $K_n$                 | $\left \lfloor{\frac{n}{2}}\right \rfloor$ | $n - 1$                                  |
| $K_{a, b}$            | $min\{a, b\}$                              | $min\{a, b\}$                            |
| $Q_n$                 | $2^{n - 1}$                                | $2^{n - 1}$                              |
| Cycle with length $n$ | $\left \lfloor{\frac{n}{2}}\right \rfloor$ | $\left \lceil{\frac{n}{2}}\right \rceil$ |
| Path with length $n$  | $\left \lceil{\frac{n}{2}}\right \rceil$   | $\left \lceil{\frac{n}{2}}\right \rceil$ |

==__Theorem^1^:__ If $G$ is bipartite, then the **size of the maximum matching** = **size of the minimum cover**.==

==__Theorem^2^:__ If $M$ is a matching in a graph $G$ that is not a maximum matching, then there is an $M$-augmenting path in $G$.==

__Proof of Theorem^2^__
Let $N$ be a matching such that $|N| \gt |M| $. Let $H$ be the subgraph of $G$ with edge set $M + N = (M \setminus N) \cup (N \setminus M)$ (_a subgraph consisting of edges that are in exactly one of $M$ or $N$_.

Every component of $H$ is either a path or a cycle (since connected & all vertices have degree 1 or 2). Since $|N| \gt |M|$, some component of $H$ has more edges in $N$. Since cycles must alternate between $M$-edges and $N$-edges (so no two from each set are adjacent to each other), they have even length and must have the same number of each type of edge. So, if the component has more edges in $N$, it must be a path, it must have odd length, and it must start and end with an $N$-edge.

Since $|N| \gt |M|$, some component of this subgraph has more edges from $N$ than from $M$. Since cycle components have equal numbers, it must be a path component. In this path, the edges are also alternating between $M$ and $N$. Thus, starting at one end of $P$, the first, third, fifth, etc (_all odd locations_) are in $N$ and the even locations are in $N$. 

The path $P$ is $M$-alternating (every second edge is in $M$). If $v$ is an end of $P$, then the edge of $P$ incident with $v$ is in $N \setminus M$. Any other edge of $G$ incident with $v$ is not in the subgraph, because $P$ is a component of the subgraph. Therefore, no edge of $M$ is incident with $v$. This, $v$ is $M$-unsaturated, showing that $P$ is an $M$-augmenting path.==$QED.$==
