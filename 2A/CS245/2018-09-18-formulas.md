# Expressions & Formulas

An __expression__ is a string of symbols (__atoms__, __connectives__, __punctuation__). A __formula__ is an expression with meaning that is not ambiguous, also known as a __well formed formula__.

### Well Formed Formulas
A WFF can be defined the following way:
Let $P$ be a set of propositional variables. Define the set of WFFs over $P$ inductively:
 1. Each propositional variable in $P$ on its own is a WFF.
 2. If $a$ is a WFF, then $(\neg a)$ is a WFF.
 3. If $a$ and $b$ are WFFs, then each of $a \wedge b$, $a \vee b$, $a \rightarrow b$, and $a \leftrightarrow b$ are WFFs.
 4. Nothing else is a WFF.

### Unique Readability
_Theorem_: Every propositional WFF has a unique derivation as a well-formed formula. That is, every propositional WFF is exactly one of the following forms:
 1. An atom
 2. $(\neg \alpha)$
 3. $(\alpha * \beta)$, where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are WFF, and $*$ is a binary connective.

> The proof is done by structural induction.
