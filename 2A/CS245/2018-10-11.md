# Predicate Logic

Propositional logic is not expressive enough.

__Ex.__ Translate the following argument to propositional logic.

All humans are mortal.
Socrates is a human.
Therefore, Socrates is mortal.

How do we capture that Socrates is a human? Or that Socrates is mortal?

A __predicate__, or __relation__, represents a property that an individual, or collection of individuals, may or may not have. In symbolic logic, we write $M(x)$ to represent $x$ has a specific property. 

We represent a predicate by the set of all things that have the property. 

_to be completed_



A __domain__, $D$, is a non-empty set. 

- Any non-empty set can be a domain (_ex. Natural numbers, people now alive, {T, F}, etc_). 
- It is important to specify a domain to accurately define the meaning of the statement.

A __constant__ is a concrete (specific) object in the domain.

A __variable__ is a placeholder for a concrete object.

A __quantifier__ is ...???

### Syntax of Predicate Logic

Seven kinds of symbols

| Symbol            | Example               |
| ----------------- | --------------------- |
| Constant symbols  | $c, d, c_1, c_2$, etc |
| Variables         | $x, y, z, x_1, y_2$   |
| Function symbols  | $f, g, h, f_1, g_2$   |
| Predicate symbols | $P, Q, P_1, Q_3$      |
| Connectives       | $\neg, \rightarrow$   |
| Quantifiers       | $\forall, \exists$    |
| Punctuation       | $. ,$                 |



In Predicate Logic, we need to consider _two types of expressions._

1. __Formulas__, those that can have a truth value
2. __Terms__, those that refer to an object of the domain
   - The set of terms is defined inductively as follows:
     1. Each constant symbol is a term, and each variable is a term. Such terms are called **atomic terms**
