# Propositions

A __proposition__ is a declarative sentence that is either `true` or `false`.
 - Cannot be both T AND F
 - Some sentences are NOT propositions (commands, questions, paradoxes, nonsensical sentences, etc)

An __atomic__ proposition is something that cannot be broken down.
 - Represented by single variable
 - Also known as __propositional variables__ or __atoms__

A __compound__ proposition can be broken down.
 - Contains symbols: __atoms__, __connectives__, __punctuation__

### Connectives in Propositions
| Connective | Interpretations |
| --- | --- |
| Negation ($\neg a$)   | not $a$, $a$ does not hold, $a$ is false, it is not the case that $a$  |
| Conjunction ($a \wedge b$)   | $a$ and $b$, $a$ but $b$, not only $a$ but $b$, $a$ while $b$, $a$ despite $b$, $a$ yet $b$, $a$ although $q$  |
| Disjunction ($a \vee b$) | $a$ or $b$, $a$ implies $b$; $b$ if $a$; $a$ only if ùëû; ùëû when $a$; $a$ is sufficient for ùëû; ùëû is necessary for $a$  |
| Conditional ($a \rightarrow b$) | $a$ implies $b$, if $a$ then $b$, $b$ if $a$, $a$ only if $b$, $b$ when $a$, $a$ is sufficient for $b$, $b$ is necessary for $a$  |
| Biconditional ($a \leftrightarrow b$)  | $a$ if and only if (iff) $b$, $a$ is equivalent to $b$, $a$ is necessary and sufficient for $b$  |

### Translating English to Propositions
 - Use positive form of propositions
 - Propositions are usually smallest the standalone sentences (_e.g._ "He is smart", NOT "Smart")
 - English is ambiguous yikes
