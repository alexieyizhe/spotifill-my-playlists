My motivation for my choice of university was based on a variety of factors. 

These included how I perceived I would fit in with the rest of my peers, the amount of freedom that I would have in terms of work and independence. 

At that time, I was split right on the fence between the University of Toronto for Computer Engineering or the University of Waterloo for Computer Science. 

There was one other factor - the opportunities in career advancement - that I didn't place as much emphasis on initially, but it was what inclined me to choose Waterloo over UofT.

 I look back on it and feel that if I knew what I do now as a second year student, it would not have been as much of a tossup as it had initially been; the competition and mentality at this school, while having been criticized for elevating the stress levels of many students here, have pushed me to get more done and help me improve myself as a person.
