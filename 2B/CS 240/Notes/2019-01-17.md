#Techniques for Algorithm Analysis

Our goal is to use asymptotic notation to simplify run-time analysis. Most of the time, the runtime of our algorithm depends on the input size, often refered to as `n`.

### General Strategies

#### Loops

The complexity of a loop is expressed as the _sum_ of the complexities of each iteration of the loop. For **nested loops**, we start with the innermost loop and proceed outwards, which will result in _nested summations._

#### Pitfalls

Algorithms can have different running times on two instances of the same size.

```pseudocode
Test3(A, n)
A: array of size n
for i <- 1 to n - 1 do
	j <- i
	while j > 0 and A[j] > A[j - 1] do
		swap A[j] and A[j - 1]
		j <- j - 1
```

Let $T_A(I)$ denote the running time of an algorithm $A$ on an instance $I$.

__Best Case:__ If our input is _already sorted._

-  We only do 1 comparison in the `while` loop.
- The outer loop iterates $n - 1$ times.
- $\Theta(n)$ running time

__Worst Case:__

#### Misc

Use $\Theta$-bounds throughout the analysis and obtain a $\Theta$-bound for the complexity of the algorithm.

Prove an $O$-bound and a matching $\Omega$-bound separately. Use upper bounds for $O$ and lower bounds for $\Omega$ frequently.

Each iteration is $\Theta(1)$ time, and the number of iterations, $N$, $$ \begin{align} N &= \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=i}^n \sum_{k=i}^j 1 \ &= \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=i}^n (j - i + 1) \end{align}) $$ Now we separate out part of the sum that depends on $j$ (the index): $$ \begin{align} &= \sum_{i=1}^n [\sum_{j=i}^n - \sum_{j=i}^n (i-1)] \ &= \sum_{i=1}^n [\sum_{j = i}^n j - (n - i + 1)(i - 1)]\end{align} $$ But now we need to put $\sum_{j=i}^n$ into a form we know $$ \begin{align} &= \sum_{i=1}^n [\sum_{j=1}^n j- \sum_{j=1}^{i-1}j-(n-i+1)(i-1)]\end{align} $$ Notice that $(n-i+1)(i-1)$ is not part of the summation. We continue to use algebra to expand to get $$ = \frac {1}{6}n^3 + \frac{1}{2}n^2 + \frac{1}{3}n $$ Alternatively, we could get $O$ and $\Omega$ separately: $$ N = \sum $$

# Abstract Data Types (ADT)

### Priority Queue

How can we create a priority queue using an existing data structure?

__Attempt 1:__ Use _unsorted arrays_ 

- Insert: $O(1)$
- deleteMax: $O(n)$

> This is identical to using unsorted _linked lists._



__Attempt 2:__ Use _sorted arrays._

- Insert: $O(n)$
- deleteMax: $O(1)$



__Attempt 3:__ Use a _binary heap._

### Binary Heap

A **binary heap** is a certain type of binary tree. Note that this is not necessarily a binary _search_ tree, where the ordering of the nodes is enforced.

![Image result for binary heap example](assets/BinaryHeap.png)

There are 2 properties of a heap:

1. **Structural**: 
   - Usually a nearly complete BT; all levels of a heap are completely filled, except for possibly the last level
   - Root has highest priority
2. **Heap-order:**
   - For any node $i$, the key of the parent of $i$ is larger than or equal to the key of $i$.
   - Basically, going down any 'branch' in the binary heap will result in descending priority.
   - This is known as a **max heap.**

However, heaps should not be stored as binary trees. Instead, we store them in an array.

![Image result for binary heap as array](assets/binary-heap-array-mapping.png)

The children of a node at index $i$ are at indices $2i + 1$ and $2i + 2$. 

#### Insertion in Heaps

1. Place the new element at the first free leaf node.

2. Swap with the node's parent if the ordering is incorrect. Continue doing so until you either reach the root node or it is in the correct place. This is known as performing a _fix-up._

   ```pseudocode
   fixUp(A, k)
   
   ```



### deleteMax in Heaps

The maximum item of a heap is just the root node, so we can delete that node. However, this means that the structure of the tree is compromised, so perform a _fix-down._ The complete steps are as follows;

1. Replace the root node with the last leaf node.
