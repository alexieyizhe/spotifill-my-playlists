# Dictionary ADT

We know that by implementing an AVL tree, we get $O(\log n)$ insert, search, and delete. However, there are properties of a Dictionary implemented using a linked list that we like, like inserting between nodes.

We can use a **Skip List.**

### Skip Lists

They are a hierarchy of ordered linked lists called _levels,_ each denoted $S_0, S_1, ..., S_h$. Each list contains $-\infty, \infty$, known as sentinel values. 

As we go down the hierarchy, the nodes get denser and denser. So, if we want to find an element, we can skip elements that are nowhere near it in terms of value, by going across the higher levels (which will skip elements) and work down levels when we need to.
