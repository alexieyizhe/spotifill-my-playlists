# Memory

### Datapaths

We separate the memory in our system into different partitions: the **instruction memory**, the **data memory**, and the **register file.**

In the instruction memory, a **program counter** keeps track of its current location (address) in the instructions. This program counter must be incremented by 4 each clock cycle in order to read the next instruction, since each 'line' is 4 bytes (32 bits) long.
