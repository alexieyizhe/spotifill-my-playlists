# Code Generation (cont.)

A **runtime environment (RTE)** is the execution environment of a program or software. It allows us to offload some of our work to different libraries, helper procedures, etc.

For converting `print` to MIPS, a **MIPS Executable Relocatable Linkable (MERL) file** will be provided that can be linked with our assembled code to provide the print function, as part of the RTE of the code.

To use these files, we can simply write `.import print` at the beginning. It will print the contents of `$1`.

So, the code for `println(expr)` would be:

```
  push($1) ; save $1
+ code(expr) ; $3 now contains expr
+ add $1, $3, $0 ; load expr into $1
+ push($31) ; save $31
+ lis $5
+ .word print
+ jalr $5 ; jump to print procedure and execute
+ pop($31) ; restore $31
+ pop($1) ; restore $1
```

### Code Conversion

We add the convention that we store the number $1$ in `$11` (which means we have true, 1, and false, 0, stored). We also store print in register `$10`.

Our code for different parts of WLP4 will look like this:

##### Control Flow (`if`, `while`)

To fix, we track how many if statements we have created, and assign the labels numerical suffixes like `else#` and `endif#` to differentiate them.

> **IMPORTANT:** We can also generate comments, so it's always helpful to generate comments that explain what you're trying to do (for debugging, clarity, documentation, etc).
