# Code Generation (cont.)

A **runtime environment (RTE)** is the execution environment of a program or software. It allows us to offload some of our work to different libraries, helper procedures, etc.

For converting `print` to MIPS, that's what we'll do. A **MIPS Executable Relocatable Linkable (MERL) file** will be provided that can be linked with our assembled code to provide the print function.

To use these files, we can simply write `.import print` at the beginning. It will print the contents of `$1`.

So, the code for `println(expr)` would be:

```
  push($1)
+ code(expr)
+ add $1, $3, $0
+ push($31)
+ lis $5
+ .word print
+ jalr $5
+ pop($31)
+ pop($1)
```

### Code Conversion

We add the convention that we store the number $1$ in `$11` (which means we have true, 1, and false, 0, stored). We also store print in register `$10`.

Our code for different parts of WLP4 will look like this:

##### Control Flow (`if`, `while`)

To fix, we track how many if statements we have created, and assign the labels numerical suffixes like `else#` and `endif#` to differentiate them.

> **IMPORTANT:** We can also generate comments, so it's always helpful to generate comments that explain what you're trying to do (for debugging, clarity, documentation, etc).
