# Code Generation: Pointers

### Dealing with `NULL`

We might want to define `NULL` as `0x0`, but this is horrible since `0x0` is a valid memory address in WLP4. We want `*NULL` to crash the program, so we can force this by picking a value for `NULL` that's not **word-aligned.** Word aligned means the address is always the start of a word, so for us, it would be a multiple of 4 (since our words are size 4).

So, we use `0x1` as our value for `NULL`.

### Taking Address Of

If we have a value `a`, we can find out where `a` is in memory using the symbol table. We load the offset and calculate the location from

### Memory Management (Allocation & Deallocation)

Then, we just `.import init` ,`.import new`, and `.import delete` to be able to use them in our MIPS code like we did for `print`!
