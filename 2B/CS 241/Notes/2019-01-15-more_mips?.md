# MIPS Instructions

Start off with an example:

> **Ex. Add the value in register 5 to value in register 7. Store the result in register 3 and return.**
>
> ```bash
> add $3, $5, $7
> jr $31
> 
> ```

### Load Immediate and Skip: `lis $d` 

With this instruction, we treat the next word as an _immediate value_ and load it into `$d`. The immediate value is probably not an instruction. Then, we skip to the next instruction (by incrementing `PC` by 4). 

### Branch Not Equal: `bne`

_Covered in CS 251_

### Set Less Than: `slt $d, $s, $t`

Set the value in `$d` to be a boolean value, more specifically the result of if `$s` is less than `$t`
