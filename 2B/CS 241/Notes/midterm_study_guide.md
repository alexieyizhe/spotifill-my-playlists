### Midterm

- Context-free languages are a subset of context-sensitive languages
  - Regular languages are a subset of context-free languages
- Converting $\epsilon$-NFA to a NFA

### Things to Practice

- Converting from 2's complement to decimal, decimal to 2's complement
- MIPS architecture
  - Conversion of high level languages into machine code
  - Parts of the MIPS architecture unit
- Writing MIPS programs
  - simple commands
  - using procedures and `jalr`
  - recursive procedures
  - MIPS I/O
- assembling assembly language into machine
  - Analysis & Synthesis
- parts of a MIPS instruction
- Bitwise operators
-  Formal languages
  - Terms & definitions
  - different language classes & hierarchy (based on difficulty to parse)
- DFAs & NFAs
  - Formal definitions
  - converting NFA to DFA
  - every DFA is an NFA
  - every NFA can be converted into a DFA
  - $\epsilon$-NFAs
    - combining two NFAs
    - recognizing regular languages with $\epsilon$-NFAs
    - converting into DFA
    - scanning a program into an  $\epsilon$-NFA
- Methods of scanning
  - Maximal munch, simplified MM
- Context Free Grammars (CFG)
  - formal definition
  - undecidability
  - top down parsing
    - algorithm to parse top down
    - predictor tables
